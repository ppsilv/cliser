It looks like your `/sys/bus/w1/devices/` directory contains symbolic links to devices, but none of them match the expected pattern for a DS18B20 temperature sensor (which typically starts with `28-`). This suggests that either:

1. The DS18B20 sensor is not being detected by the Raspberry Pi.
2. The sensor is not properly connected or configured.

Letâ€™s troubleshoot and resolve this step by step.

---

### **1. Verify Sensor Wiring**
Ensure the DS18B20 sensor is wired correctly to the Raspberry Pi:

- **VCC**: Connect to 3.3V (Pin 1 on GPIO header).
- **GND**: Connect to Ground (Pin 6 on GPIO header).
- **Data**: Connect to GPIO4 (Pin 7 on GPIO header) with a **4.7kÎ© pull-up resistor** between the Data pin and 3.3V.

---

### **2. Verify 1-Wire Interface is Enabled**
The 1-Wire interface must be enabled for the DS18B20 sensor to be detected.

1. **Enable 1-Wire in `raspi-config`**:
   - Run the following command to open the Raspberry Pi configuration tool:
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
   - Navigate to **Interfacing Options** â†’ **1-Wire** and enable it.
   - Reboot the Raspberry Pi:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

2. **Verify 1-Wire Kernel Modules**:
   - After rebooting, check if the `w1_gpio` and `w1_therm` kernel modules are loaded:
     ```bash
     lsmod | grep w1
     ```
   - You should see output like this:
     ```
     w1_therm               20480  0
     w1_gpio                16384  0
     wire                   36864  2 w1_gpio,w1_therm
     ```

---

### **3. Check for Sensor Detection**
After enabling 1-Wire and verifying the wiring, check if the DS18B20 sensor is detected:

1. **List Devices in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/`**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
     ```
   - If the DS18B20 sensor is detected, you should see a directory with a name starting with `28-` (e.g., `28-00000xxxxxxx`).

2. **If the Sensor is Not Detected**:
   - Double-check the wiring, especially the pull-up resistor.
   - Ensure the sensor is powered correctly (3.3V, not 5V).
   - Try a different DS18B20 sensor if possible, as the sensor itself might be faulty.

---

### **4. Update Rust Code to Handle Current Devices**
Since your `/sys/bus/w1/devices/` directory contains devices with prefixes like `00-`, you can update your Rust code to handle these devices. However, note that these devices are not DS18B20 sensors (which use the `28-` prefix).

If you want to check for other types of 1-Wire devices, you can modify the `get_sensor_id` function to list all devices:

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::Error;

pub fn get_sensor_id() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let dir = "/sys/bus/w1/devices";
    for entry in fs::read_dir(dir)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        let path = entry.path();
        if path.is_dir() {
            let device_id = path.file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap();
            println!("Found device: {}", device_id);
        }
    }
    Err(Error::new(std::io::ErrorKind::NotFound, "No DS18B20 sensor found"))
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    match get_sensor_id() {
        Ok(_) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Error: {}", e);
            Err(e)
        },
    }
}
```

This will list all devices in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/`, but it wonâ€™t find a DS18B20 sensor unless one is connected and detected.

### **5. Debugging Steps**
1. **Check Kernel Logs**:
   - Look for 1-Wire-related messages in the kernel logs:
     ```bash
     dmesg | grep w1
     ```
   - This might provide clues about why the DS18B20 sensor is not being detected.

2. **Test with Python Script**:
   - Use a Python script to verify if the sensor is detected:
     ```python
     import os
     import glob

     base_dir = '/sys/bus/w1/devices/'
     device_folders = glob.glob(base_dir + '28*')

     if not device_folders:
         print("No DS18B20 sensor found.")
     else:
         for device_folder in device_folders:
             print(f"Found DS18B20 sensor: {device_folder}")
     ```

3. **Check Power Supply**:
   - Ensure the DS18B20 sensor is receiving adequate power. A weak power supply can cause detection issues.

---

### **6. Common Issues**
- **Incorrect Wiring**:
  - Double-check the connections, especially the pull-up resistor.
- **Faulty Sensor**:
  - Try a different DS18B20 sensor.
- **1-Wire Not Enabled**:
  - Ensure the 1-Wire interface is enabled in `raspi-config`.

---

### **Summary**
- Verify the wiring and power supply for the DS18B20 sensor.
- Enable the 1-Wire interface and check if the sensor is detected.
- Update your Rust code to handle the current devices in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/`.

If the DS18B20 sensor is still not detected, let me know, and we can dive deeper into debugging! ðŸ˜Š
